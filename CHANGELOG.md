## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The implementation plan, README, licence and working rules.
- The project (`project.yml`, iOS 18, Swift 6), an app that launches to a placeholder, and a
  launch UI test (B0).
- `ServerSupport`, `OwnAudioKit` and `PlayerCore`, copied from own.audio Music without their
  music-only parts; `scripts/` for tests against real servers, TestFlight and the App Store.
- `AudiobookshelfKit`: a client for Audiobookshelf 2.x — sign-in with rotating tokens (2.26+)
  or the older single token, libraries, items, series, authors, narrators, collections, the
  home shelves, search, progress, bookmarks, play sessions and local sessions, media and cover
  URLs, and a repair for mis-encoded titles (B1).
